Database Projects

# Assignment 1A
Purpose: Given the provided case study, we are asked to transform the
information provided in the case study into a full conceptual model as the
first step towards a database design. This task covers learning outcomes:
1. Apply the theories of the relational database model.
2. Develop a sound relational database design.

# Assignment 1B
Purpose: Given the provided case study from assignment 1A, and additional
forms/documents related to the case study, we will be asked to
transform the information provided into a sound database design and
implement it in Oracle. This task covers learning outcomes:
1. Apply the theories of the relational database model.
2. Develop a sound relational database design.
3. Implement a relational database based on a sound database
design.

# Assignment 2A
Purpose: We will be asked to implement, via SQL, a small database in the Oracle
RDBMS from a provided logical model case study, followed by the insert of
appropriate data to the created tables. Once populated the database will be used
to carry out specified DML commands and make specified changes to the
database structure via SQL. This task covers learning outcomes:
1. Apply the theories of the relational database model.
3. Implement a relational database based on a sound database design.
4. Manage data that meets user requirements, including queries and
transactions.

# Assignment 2B
Purpose: We will be asked to use SQL and NoSQL to write queries to produce
specified output. This task covers learning outcomes:
1. Apply the theories of the relational database model.
4. Manage data that meets user requirements, including queries and
transactions.
5. Contrast the differences between non-relational database models and the
relational database model.
